# Introduction
This java utility convert/merge multiple csv, tsv, text files to excel (xlsx) files. I created this to convert biological data (DE results, gene lists etc.) from txt format to excel.

**This automatically takes care of gene names without converting them to dates.**

### Key Features:

* Provides simple GUI; easy to use
* Supports multiple files
* Auto-detect delimiter for each input file
* Outputs can be single or multiple XLSX files, as specified by user.
* Files never leave the user's computer
* Works with Linux, Windows, and Mac
